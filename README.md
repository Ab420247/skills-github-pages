**Markdown syntax** enables you to format documents using plain text. It supports **headings**, _italic_, **bold**, and _**bold italic**_ text. You can create lists using dashes or asterisks for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists. Hyperlinks can be embedded using brackets and parentheses, while inline code and code blocks can be highlighted with backticks. Markdown is widely used due to its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for documentation and web content.
